## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahrkeenerh/TaskLord
cd TaskLord
```

2. Set up the backend:
```bash
pip install flask flask-cors werkzeug
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Manual Start

Run the included `run.sh` file, which will:
1. Start the backend server (port 3002)
2. Start the frontend development server (port 3001)
3. Open the application at `http://localhost:3001`

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Auto-Start on Boot (Linux with systemd)

To have TaskLord start automatically when your system boots:

1. Install the systemd service:
```bash
sudo cp tasklord.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable tasklord.service
sudo systemctl start tasklord.service
```

2. Check service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status tasklord.service
```

3. View logs:
```bash
# System logs
journalctl -u tasklord.service -f

# Application logs
tail -f logs/backend.log
tail -f logs/frontend.log
```

4. Useful commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop tasklord.service    # Stop the service
sudo systemctl restart tasklord.service # Restart the service
sudo systemctl disable tasklord.service # Disable auto-start
```

## Data Storage

The application uses a file-based storage system with the following structure:
- `months/`: Contains JSON files for each month's time entries
- `logos/`: Stores client logo files
- `clients.json`: Client information
- `projects.json`: Project definitions
- `recurring.json`: Recurring task configurations

## Features in Detail

### Time Tracking
- Add, edit, and delete time entries
- Set up recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Associate entries with specific projects and clients
- Add notes to time entries

### Recurring Tasks
- Create tasks that repeat daily, weekly, or monthly
- Editing a recurring task:
  - Changes made to a recurring task will update all subsequent instances of that task
  - To modify a single instance, uncheck the "recurring" option when editing - this unlinks it from the recurring series
  - Historical entries (before the edited date) remain unchanged
- Deleting a recurring task:
  - Removes the selected task and all future occurrences
  - Past entries remain unchanged

### Project Management
- Create and manage multiple projects
- Assign projects to clients
- Set custom colors for visual organization
- Configure hourly rates per project

### Client Management
- Create and manage client profiles
- Upload and manage client logos
- View client-specific project lists
- Generate client-specific summaries

### Reporting
- Monthly summaries by client and project
- Hours tracked and financial calculations
- Export-friendly photo mode for clean visuals

### User Interface
- Responsive calendar view
- Quick-access task creation
- Filtering by client and project

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Headless UI for accessible components
- Lucide React for icons

### Backend
- Flask (Python)
- Flask-CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
- Custom file-based storage system
